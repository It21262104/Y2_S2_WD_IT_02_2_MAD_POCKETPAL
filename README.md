MAD - Financial Management Mobile Application

# Description about the overall project 

The problem that we identified related to the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka is that people face 
troubles in managing their monthly income efficiently since the living expenditures are much high. As a 
solution, we decided to develop a financial management mobile application. 
The main purpose of this application is to provide methods for users to manage their income efficiently. 
A user must register for the application to get the services. News related to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka 
will be displayed and will be updated daily. So that the users can stay updated on the current situation. 
There are 4 main modules in the application which are budgeting, bill payment, credit monitoring, and 
financial goal setting. The users can plan their expenditures, get notified of pending payments, calculate 
the net income of the month, and be motivated for saving money by referring to these modules. The users 
can provide feedback for the service according to their satisfaction. Apart from that, whenever a customer 
logs in to the system, a mental health tip will be displayed on the dashboard daily to increase awareness 
of mental health which is also essential during a crisis.
