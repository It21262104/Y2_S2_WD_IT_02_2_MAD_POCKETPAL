MAD - Financial Management Mobile Application

# Description about the overall project 

The problem that we identified related to the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka is that people face 
troubles in managing their monthly income efficiently since the living expenditures are much high. As a 
solution, we decided to develop a financial management mobile application. 
The main purpose of this application is to provide methods for users to manage their income efficiently. 
A user must register for the application to get the services. News related to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka 
will be displayed and will be updated daily. So that the users can stay updated on the current situation. 
There are 4 main modules in the application which are budgeting, bill payment, credit monitoring, and 
financial goal setting. The users can plan their expenditures, get notified of pending payments, calculate 
the net income of the month, and be motivated for saving money by referring to these modules. The users 
can provide feedback for the service according to their satisfaction. Apart from that, whenever a customer 
logs in to the system, a mental health tip will be displayed on the dashboard daily to increase awareness 
of mental health which is also essential during a crisis.

# Individual Contribution 

## IT21262104 – Budget Controller 
This section helps the user to manage the budget for a relevant month. Once the user enters the month, 
salary, and the categories that want to spend money with the expected percentages, the system will 
automatically calculate and display the amounts of money. If the summation of the percentage amounts 
that the user entered is greater than 100, an alert will be sent to the user automatically. Therefore, the 
user can plan to use the monthly income efficiently at the beginning of the month. The user can update, 
delete, or add a new category as preferred. 

## IT21261732 – Bill Payment 
This section helps to keep track of all bill details and reminds the due dates of bills monthly wise. Initially, 
users need to add the bill details including amount, category, and due date. If the user needs reminders 
for due dates, they can set reminders. The system calculates the total amount of the bills that need to pay 
and displays it to the users. After settling bill payment user can add that bill as paid. Then the system 
calculates the total amount of paid bills. Users can update the bill details and delete the bills when they 
are not needed.
 
## IT21258312 – Credit Monitoring 
This section manages and monitors the credit limits and expenses. Initially, the total credit amount for the 
month should be inserted and whenever the user spends on a certain thing that amount and the details 
should be inserted. Then the system calculates and shows the remaining credit amount on the dashboard 
and keeps records of the respective expense. Also, the system compares the expense rate with previous 
months and if it detects an anomalous rate of spending, an alert is shown. The records and the amounts 
could be updated and deleted according to the necessity of the user.
 
## IT21259852 – Financial Goal Setting 
Financial goal setting in this application allows users to set a financial goal, such as buying a new car or 
starting their own business and saving XXX amount of money for that. Users can insert the amount needed 
to achieve the goal and the number of months they want to save it for. The application will calculate and 
display the amount users need to save each month to reach their set goal. User can edit their financial 
goal (crud) if they change their mind, additionally, this module will include hyperlinks to financial websites 
to provide users better-investing ideas.
